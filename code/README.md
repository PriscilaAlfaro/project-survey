# Survey Tool

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## Usage

1. On GitHub, click the 'use this template' button to create a new repo on your account
1. Clone the new repo to your computer
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`

Alternatively, if you don't want a new git repo on your account;

1. Open the directory in the terminal: `cd /path/to/react-starter`
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
