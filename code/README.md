# Survey Tool

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

# The problem
The aproach this week was to create a survey to build a story whith the responses from the forms. I tried some different types of forms like radio, text, range and dropdown, mix with some images. 
I tried to create separated elements for question and answers depending on the question number. The data come from a json document created in scr. The logic from next and previous question was based on the number of question, the answers were saved in an object to used at the end with a story.
