# Survey Tool

This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

# The problem

The aproach this week was to create a survey to build a story whith the responses from the forms. I tried some different types of forms like radio, text, range and dropdown, mix with some images. 
I tried to create separated elements for question and answer depending on the question number. 
The data come from a json document created in scr. The logic of next and previous question was based on the number of question and at the same time to display the correct question/options. The answers were saved in an object to used at the end with to create a story. 
I was inspired by a typeForm of starwars in the examples of the project in Notion.


## Usage

1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
2. Start the project: `npm start`
